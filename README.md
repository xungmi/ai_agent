# Structure output
here are some example instructions you could add to your prompts to request output in certain formats:

    "Return the response as raw markdown so that I can directly use it in my markdown processing pipeline. Don't add any extra annotations or explanations."

    "Return just the plain text, NOT formatted as markdown, without adding any extra annotations or explanations"

    "Return just the code, NOT formatted as markdown, without adding any extra annotations or explanations"

    "Return the data using CSV formatting. Use commas (not semicolons) as separators. Don't add any extra annotations or explanations."
